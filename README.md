# BiodataFeather
Feather daughter board for the Adafruit ESP32 and Huzzah (and others), allowing BLE and RTPMIDI via wifi.
Still a work in progress, and can provide the framework for anyone to use other Adafruit Feather boards
     Lots of Biodata information on my website electricityforprogress.com
